# Word-Search-Generator
Word Search Generator is a demonstration of a multi-method program with user input and low redundancy. This allows us to test multiple ways to place a word in the word search box with ease before it is placed, as well as take user input to store data for the words for the word search.

This program uses 1 class:
- WordSearchGenerator: This includes methods for an intro, generating words and the grid, placing words with correct direction AND diagonals, printing the word search, and finally showing a solution.

In this way we are able to create a database of words, place them on a grid in correct direction, print the grid (word search) for the player, and then show them the correct answer at the end by leveraging x's in place of incorrect areas.
